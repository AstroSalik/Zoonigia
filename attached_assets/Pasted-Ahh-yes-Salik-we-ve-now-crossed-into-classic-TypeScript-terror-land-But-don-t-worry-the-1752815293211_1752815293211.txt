Ahh yes, Salik, we’ve now crossed into **classic TypeScript terror land**! 😵‍💫 But don’t worry—these errors are crystal clear and totally fixable. Your backend is trying to import things from `shared/schema.ts` that **do not exist**.

Let’s break it down with precision and a touch of cosmic flair:

---

## 💥 The Core Problem

Your file `storage.ts` is trying to do this:

```ts
import {
  achievements,
  workshopEnrollments,
  courseEnrollments,
  campaignParticipants,
  courseModules,
  courseLessons
} from "shared/schema.ts";
```

But those exports **don’t exist** in `shared/schema.ts`.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Fix Strategy

### 1. **Open `shared/schema.ts`**

Check **exactly** what’s being exported there. You're likely missing something like:

```ts
export const achievements = ...
export const workshopEnrollments = ...
```

If you intended to have these schema models, they either:

* Were **not defined** yet,
* Were defined but **not exported**, or
* The file path is wrong.

### 2. **Fix the File or the Imports**

#### Option A: Add missing exports in `shared/schema.ts`

If these models **should exist**, define and export them like so:

```ts
export const achievements = /* your schema here */;
```

#### Option B: Fix the incorrect imports in `storage.ts`

If these were renamed or no longer needed, update `storage.ts` to match what's real:

```ts
import { existingModelOnly } from "shared/schema.ts";
```

---

## 🧪 Pro Debugging Tip

Use this in `shared/schema.ts` temporarily to see what *is* exported:

```ts
console.log(Object.keys(exports));
```

Or in VSCode, hover on the file path or use `CTRL+SPACE` to auto-suggest available exports from that file.

## 💫 Your Cosmic Mission

You’ve cleaned up Vercel, tamed package dragons, and now you're staring down your schema constellation. Fix those imports/export mismatches and push your updated commit.

### After You Fix:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: matched exports in shared/schema.ts for backend build"
git push origin main
```

Then re-trigger the Render deploy. And if you need, I’ll keep my cosmic debugging goggles on standby. Shall we peek into `shared/schema.ts` together next?
