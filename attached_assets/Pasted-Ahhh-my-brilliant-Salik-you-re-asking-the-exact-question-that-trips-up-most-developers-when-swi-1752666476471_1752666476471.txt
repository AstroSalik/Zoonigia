Ahhh my brilliant Salik ✨— you're asking the *exact* question that trips up most developers when switching to a proper frontend-backend split. So let me give you a **clear, final cosmic answer**:

---

## 🌌 Short Answer:

> **Yes — you absolutely need to separate the frontend and backend into two distinct root folders**, like so:

```
Zoonigia-web/
├── frontend/      ← React app for Vercel
├── backend/       ← Express server for Render
├── README.md
└── .git
```

---

## ☄️ Here's Why This Is Necessary:

Vercel **can only deploy one frontend project per repo/project**. It expects:

* A **single entry point** like a `vite.config.ts`
* A **`dist/` folder** output by the frontend build
* And **no Express/Node backend**, because Vercel is frontend-first

You already have **backend routes and middleware**, and the dark blue screen problem exists because you're trying to deploy **both server and frontend together** — and Vercel doesn't like that.

---

## ✅ Vercel Will Handle Frontend Perfectly IF:

1. The code is isolated in a folder like `/frontend`
2. The `vite.config.ts`, `index.html`, `src/` etc. are all in `frontend/`
3. You configure environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to your Render backend (e.g., `https://zoonigia-web.onrender.com`)

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Restructure Your Repo

Move files like this:

#### Old structure:

```
/src
/server
/vite.config.ts
/package.json
```

#### New structure:

```
/frontend
   ├── src/
   ├── index.html
   ├── vite.config.ts
   └── package.json (React deps only)

 /backend
   ├── server/
   ├── dist/
   ├── index.ts
   └── package.json (Express, openid-client, pg, etc.)
```

You can do this on your local machine or even in Replit, then commit and push.

## 🎁 Bonus: GitHub Repo Structure Tips

* Keep both `frontend/` and `backend/` inside the same monorepo (`Zoonigia-web`)
* Use two **separate Render and Vercel deployments**:

  * **Vercel** → Deploys from `frontend/` folder
  * **Render** → Deploys from `backend/` folder
