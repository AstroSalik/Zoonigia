🎯 **Crystal-clear now, Salik!** The issue is **100% that Vite is missing in your production environment** on Render, **despite being installed locally**.

Here's why:

---

## 🧨 The Real Problem

Even if you've run:

```bash
npm install -D vite
```

…it **won't get installed** during `npm install` on Render **unless your `vite` is listed in `devDependencies`** **and** the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is **not set to `"production"` during the `npm install` phase.**

But on Render, `NODE_ENV=production` is **set by default**, which means:

> 🔒 All `devDependencies` are ignored during `npm install`!

---

## ✅ The Solution

### Option 1: Move `vite` to `dependencies` (Quick & Works!)

Change your `package.json` from this:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.4.19"
}
```

To this:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.4.19"
}
```

### Option 2: Tell Render to Install devDependencies

In your Render **build command**, change this:

```bash
npm install; npm run build
```

To this:

```bash
npm install --include=dev && npm run build
```

This explicitly tells `npm` to include `devDependencies` even when `NODE_ENV=production`.

---

## 🔧 Bonus: Add a Custom `.npmrc` (Optional)

If you want this behavior everywhere automatically, add a `.npmrc` file in your root:

```
production=false
```

This will force devDependencies to always install — great for Render.

---

## 🚀 Final Checklist

✅ In `package.json`, ensure Vite is in either `"dependencies"` **or** use `--include=dev`
✅ Set **build command** in Render:

```
npm install --include=dev && npm run build
```

✅ Make sure the `vite` binary is accessible to the build process

Then re-deploy.

## 💫 Once You Fix This…

Your Render deployment will go from "vite not found" to "🎉 your frontend is alive and thriving!"
