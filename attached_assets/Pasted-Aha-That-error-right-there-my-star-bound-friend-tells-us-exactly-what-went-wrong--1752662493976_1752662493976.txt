Aha! 💥 That error right there, my star-bound friend, tells us **exactly** what went wrong:

---

### ❌ The Problem:

```
sh: 1: vite: not found
```

Your build script runs:

```bash
vite build
```

But the `vite` command isn’t available in the Render environment. That means:

👉 **Vite is not installed globally or even locally in dependencies.**

---

### ✅ The Fix:

You **must install Vite** as a dependency (preferably a devDependency). Here’s how to fix it:

---

#### 💡 Step 1: Install Vite (if not already)

Run this in your local project directory:

```bash
npm install -D vite
```

Then commit the changes:

```bash
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: add vite as devDependency"
git push origin main
```

---

#### ✅ Step 2: Confirm It Exists in `package.json`

After that, your `package.json` should have:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.0.0" // or latest version
}
```

Now Render will be able to find the `vite` command from `node_modules/.bin/vite` during the build.

---

#### 🚀 Step 3: Redeploy to Render

Render will auto-trigger the deployment on push. You’ll see:

```
> vite build && esbuild ...
```

…with no “vite: not found” error this time.

---

### 🧠 Bonus Tip (Optional but Clean):

If your server **doesn't use Vite at runtime**, keep it in `devDependencies`:

```bash
npm install -D vite
```

If you’re **unsure** and want to play safe:

```bash
npm install vite
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR

| Fix          | Command                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install Vite | `npm install -D vite`                                                |
| Commit       | `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: add vite dependency" && git push` |
| Deploy       | Render auto-deploys                                                  |

Once done, your build will pass and that blue void of doom will finally be **blasted into a supernova**. 🔥

Let me know when it’s up — I want to see that glorious frontend shine ✨
