🎯 **Boom! That error message is crystal clear and totally fixable.** You're now in the *“classic monorepo gotcha”* territory, and let me gently walk you out of it like your tech-savvy twin.

## ❌ What’s Causing the Build Failure?

You're getting:

```
Rollup failed to resolve import "drizzle-orm/pg-core" from "/frontend/shared/schema.ts"
```

Because:

1. `drizzle-orm/pg-core` is a **backend-only dependency**.
2. But you're trying to **import it in the frontend project** via this:

   ```
   frontend/shared/schema.ts
   ```
3. Vercel (frontend-only) tries to build the frontend and chokes when it hits this import meant for Node/Postgres/Drizzle.

---

## 🧠 The Root of the Issue:

You've shared `schema.ts` between backend and frontend — but it uses **backend-specific imports** (`pg-core`, etc.).

> In simple words: **frontend is trying to speak backend lingo**, and Vercel’s like: “I don’t speak that language.” 💥

---

## ✅ Here's What You Need to Do

### 💡 Step 1: **Split the shared schema**

You need **two schema files**:

| File                       | Used In  | Contains                               |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `backend/shared/schema.ts` | Backend  | Drizzle Postgres schema (`pg-core`) ✅  |
| `frontend/shared/types.ts` | Frontend | Only TS interfaces, enums, constants ✅ |

---

### 💡 Step 2: **Remove drizzle import from frontend**

1. Go to:

   ```
   frontend/shared/schema.ts
   ```

2. 🔥 **Delete or comment out any `import` that looks like:**

   ```ts
   import { pgTable, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
   ```

3. If you need to define a type for the frontend:

   ```ts
   export interface Campaign {
     id: string;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     // etc...
   }
   ```

---

### 💡 Step 3: **Create a separate shared file just for types**

If both frontend and backend need to share some structure:

✅ Create a neutral TypeScript file:

```
shared/types/campaign.ts
```

Contents:

```ts
export interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
}
```

Backend imports that.
Frontend imports that.
Nobody gets confused. No Vercel explosions. 🔥

---

### 💡 Step 4: **Commit & Push**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: removed backend-specific imports from frontend schema"
git push origin main
```

---

### 🔁 Step 5: **Redeploy on Vercel**

Now go back to Vercel, and hit **“Redeploy”** for your frontend project.

---

## 💎 Bonus Tip (Optional But Wise)

If you need to **share types across frontend and backend**, create a neutral folder at root like:

```
shared/
  └── types/
        └── campaign.ts
```

Then in `frontend/tsconfig.json`, make sure to include that path:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@shared/*": ["../shared/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 🧼 Summary – What You Just Did

✅ **Frontend now only contains frontend logic**
✅ **Backend can keep its Drizzle magic**
✅ **Shared types remain neutral and portable**
✅ **Vercel can now build happily ever after**

Now go do the tweak, deploy it like a boss, and I’ll be right here to guide the **Render backend** setup next. Let’s finally get Zoonigia soaring 🚀
